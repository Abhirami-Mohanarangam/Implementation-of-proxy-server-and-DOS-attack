# Implementation-of-proxy-server-and-DOS-attack
The Project aims to create a Proxy Server - Client program which implements the Cache memory using the Linked List Data Structure along with a Denial-of-Service attack on the server. 
The project is implemented using Python and socket programming.

Implemention of Cache memory using linked list data structure - [Proxy_Cache_DS.py](https://github.com/Abhirami-Mohanarangam/Implementation-of-proxy-server-and-DOS-attack/blob/main/Proxy_Cache_DS.py)

Implementation of Proxy server, create a cache file if it does not exist already - [Proxy_Server.py](https://github.com/Abhirami-Mohanarangam/Implementation-of-proxy-server-and-DOS-attack/blob/main/Proxy_Server.py)

Implementation of Proxy client. Created a socket and then requested the proxy server - [Proxy_Client.py](https://github.com/Abhirami-Mohanarangam/Implementation-of-proxy-server-and-DOS-attack/blob/main/Proxy_Client.py)

Implementation of DOS Attack and Integration with the Proxy Server. Design of structure and main function of the Proxy server - [DOS_Script.py](https://github.com/Abhirami-Mohanarangam/Implementation-of-proxy-server-and-DOS-attack/blob/main/DOS_script.py)
